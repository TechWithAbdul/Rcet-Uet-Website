                <h3>Bs.Computer Science</h3>
                <p>The department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in 2008 and is currently offering 
                    a degree course in Computer Science at undegraduate level. The mission of Computer Science and 
                    Engineering Department is to equip the students with up-to-date curricula of computer science and 
                    engineering disciplines, to ensure that the students have the solid foundations in the core concepts 
                    in computing and Engineering disciplines, to train them in problem solving and decision making skills 
                    and to prepare them for lifelong learning in the discipline. The departmet has qualified faculty comprising 
                    of three PhD faculty members and seven holds MPhil degree. In order to develop the qualified faculty, several 
                    teachers were provided financial grants to go abroad for postgraduate studies leading to Doctorate in computer science. 
                    The department introduced the 4 year B.Sc. in Computer Science in 2008. The B.Sc. Computer Science Program is 
                    accrediated by National Computing and Accreditation Council (NCEAC)..</p>

                <h3>Mechanical Engineering</h3>
                <p>Mechanical Engineering is one of the major divisions within the profession and its principles are involved in the 
                    design, development and construction of nearly all of the physical devices and systems which technology has produced. 
                    Mechanical engineers are also concerned with the operations of all kinds of machinery, and the production of power. 
                    They must conceive, research, design, develop, test, manufacture and sell equipment for these purposes. This course 
                    will introduce you to the realm of mechanical engineering and the relationships between mathematics, physics, 
                    communications and sciences which is important for the study, design, analysis and manufacturing of mechanical 
                    products and systems.</p>
